## Repository for the course "Research on Corporate Transparency" Summer 2025

This repository contains the code and data that we use throughout the course. Following how this repository grows over time should also give you an idea of how to structure an open science research project. The repository is organized in a way that allows us to easily reproduce the results and share the code with others.


### Overview

- The folder `data` contains all the data that we use in the course (see below for more detail). 
- The folder `scripts` contains all scripts that produce outputs meant for people to digest. When adding a script, please extend the `README.md` file in the folder to explain what the script does and how it should be used.
- These outputs are stored in the `output` folder. Its content is not committed to the repository but meant to be generated by running the scripts of the `script`folder. 


### Data folder structure

- `external`: Data that we have obtained form external sources, meaning that they cannot be replicated by running the code in this repository. When adding to this folder, please make sure to add info to the README.md file that explains where the data comes from and how it should be understood/used.


### Process to fork/clone and work with this repository

To work with this repository, we recommend that you, after registering with GitHub and logging in, fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
That way, you will be able to work in the repository, extending and reusing our code without interfering with the development in the main repo. 

Here is a video that explains how to do it:

</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Next, you can either clone your forked repository in your local development environment, or, if you have no suitable environment, use GitHub Codespaces to set a development environment up in the cloud.
A GitHub account currently includes 30 monthly hours of free Codespaces usage and GitHub Codespaces are a great way to define accessible development environments for anybody, supporting the idea of Open Science.

Again, a short video might help you to understand the process:

</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Finally, as this repository is using R as its main statistical programming language, most of us might be more familiar with using RStudio as a development environment. 
We configured the development container for GitHub Codespaces to start RStudio Server and so you can choose whether you want to stick to Visual Studio Code or use RStudio.

Here is the video that details how you can log on to the RStudio server instance of your development container:

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Finally, as this repository will grow as the course matures, it might be wise to sync your fork and update your cloned repository from time to time so that your repositories stay in sync with the main repository. 

This is how you can do that:

### I have no idea about scientific computing - Where do I start?

If you are new to scientific computing, we suggest that you also pick up a reference from the list below and browse through it. The [Gentzkow and Shapiro (2014) paper](https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/CodeAndData.pdf) is a particularly easy and also useful read. For those that are new to R, I suggest that you take a look into the [awesome text book 'R for Data Science'](https://r4ds.had.co.nz).

If you want to set up your very own R computing environment, we have "produced" a [series of short videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-9XqvJlFJ-5NDUXubrbvF3aEQPeoAki3) that guide you through the process of setting up your computing environment and using a [repository similar to this one](https://github.com/trr266/treat). Also, there is a [blog post](https://joachim-gassen.github.io/2021/03/get-a-treat/) that details these steps in a written form.
